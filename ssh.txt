** don't wanna enter password everytime when using ssh to connect a remote server? **
1) edit your "~/.ssh/config", add 2 lines at the head of it:
### begin ###
ControlMaster auto
ControlPath /tmp/ssh_mux_%h_%p_%r
### end ###
and then you only need to enter your password at the first time you want to connect your server


** common login user config **
1) edit your "~/.ssh/config", add every host like this:
### begin ###
Host ud
HostName 127.0.0.1
Port 22
IdentityFile /home/yourname/.ssh/some_of_your_priv_key_name.pri
### end ###
"Host" is the shortcut you define, "HostName" is the ip or server_name, "IdentityFile" may be different each other when you need to login different server, and you can specify it here
