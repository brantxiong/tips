** make symblic link to some file **
eg. "ln -s a.txt b.txt" means to create a symblic file named "b.txt" linked to "a.txt"
you can check it by "ls -alh b.txt", to see that:
lrwxrwxrwx 1 busuncle busuncle 5 2013-04-18 10:53 b.txt -> a.txt
modifying both files will do the same thing to each other



** run a command as another user only once **
eg. Suppose you are root now, type this:
### begin ###
su -l busuncle -c "touch abc.txt"
### end ###
you will see that "abc.txt" is created by busuncle, but you are still logined as root


** nohup **
eg.very easy:
nohup python test_nohup.py > nohup.out 2>&1 &


** write portable hd in mac **
diskuti info /Volumes/your_portable_hd_name | grep "Device Node" # remember the result
hdiutil eject /Volumes/your_portable_hd_name 
sudo mkdir /Volumes/myhd
sudo mount_ntfs -o rw,nobrowse the_result_in_fisrt_step /Volumes/myhd
then you can cd /Volumes/myhd and read+write on it
