** run rsync as a daemon **
1) successfully installed rsync that make "/etc/init.d/rsync" available
2) open and edit the file "/etc/default/rsync", modify the variable to "true" as below:
### begin ###
RSYNC_ENABLE=true
### end ###
3) open and edit the config file, here is an example:
### begin ###
log file=/var/log/rsyncd.log    # log file path
port=8873   # you can set user-defined port here, usually beyound 1024

[tmp]
comment = write down your description about this rsync folder
path = /home/busuncle/tmp/  # the folder that can be access("r" or "rw" depending on your "read only" option below)
hosts allow = 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.2   # ip list that you allow to access the folder, seperated by a blank 
uid = nobody    # change the user as you wish
gid = nogroup   # the group
read only = true    # or false
### end ###
and then, on your local machine(also have rsync installed), type command like this:
### begin ###
rsync --port 8873 -av /home/busuncle/source_folder your_rsync_daemon_machine_ip::tmp/
### end ###
this will transfer your source_folder files to your rsync machine in corresponding directory, 
or you may change the rsync transfer direction by shifting the source and destination like this:
### begin ###
rsync --port 8873 -av your_rsync_daemon_machine_ip::tmp/ /home/busuncle/destination_folder/
### end ###
pay attention to the tailing "/", or that may destroy your folder ...
